## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Structure
```sql
- simple_hospital_applications (main application table)
- simple_application_documents (document storage)
- simple_application_evaluations (scoring records)
- simple_contracts (contract management)
- onboarding_progress (progress tracking)
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/onboarding/application - Submit application
POST /api/onboarding/evaluate/:id - Evaluate and score
POST /api/onboarding/generate-contract/:id - Generate contract
POST /api/onboarding/sign-contract/:id - Digital signing
GET /api/onboarding/applications - List applications
GET /api/onboarding/progress/:id - Track progress
```

### File Management
- **Upload Directory**: /uploads/ (for application documents)
- **Contract Directory**: /contracts/ (for generated PDFs)
- **File Types Supported**: All document types up to 10MB

### Scoring Algorithm
```javascript
// Weighted average calculation
totalScore = (infrastructure + staff + equipment + compliance + financial) / 5
status = totalScore >= 70 ? 'approved' : 'rejected'
```

## Live System Access

### Frontend
- **URL**: https://hms-frontend-final-morphvm-mkofwuzh.http.cloud.morph.so
